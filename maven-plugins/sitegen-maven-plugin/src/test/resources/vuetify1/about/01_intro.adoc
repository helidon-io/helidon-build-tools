A brief introduction of Pet project

== In brief

Pet Project is about nothing and everything, like every other pet project :)

[PILLARS]
====

[CARD]
.More Fun Less Trouble
[icon=code]
--
Pet Project is like every other cool project on the block, it makes all promises
 you want to see. It's cool, it's flashy, and it will solve everything.
--

[CARD]
.Lightening Fast
[icon=flash_on]
--
Of course, we are fast as hell! Otherwise, why would we claim it ? Duh! Speed is
 relative of course to your experience. When in doubt consult with Gandalf, he
 knows better.
--

[CARD]
.Relax, you are in the right spot
[icon=hot_tub]
--
It's now the time to take it easy, with Pet Project you can make all of your
 dreams come true. Let's be as cheesy as possible, you can do it, but do what ?
 Do everything you need while sitting in a hot tub, the dream!!!
--

[CARD]
.Do not be shy, innovate!
[icon=explore]
--
Innovation is key to success, however it does not come without cost. This is a
 constant effort that must be pursed fearlessly. Brave adventurers will be
 known for the posterity, trust Gandalf, he said that.
--

[CARD]
.A world full of plugins!
[icon=extension,link=02_contributing.adoc]
--
Plugins plugins plugins! Ship an empty shell for free and give the illusion of
 cost free software, and then make them PAY! Well, Gandalf did not say that for
 once, but he would not give me any tips for this card, so it just came up like
 that.
--

[CARD]
.We are bug free!
[icon=bug_report]
--
As the cream of the cream, we ship bug free software. Yup that's it, no less.
We are so good that we write bug free code from the start. Even Donald Knuth
 cannot do better than us, unbelievable right ? Well, that's what happens when
 the great wizard is among you and writes code :)
--

[CARD]
.Motorcycles are so cool
[icon=motorcycle]
--
A motorcycle is all you need in life. Get one and everything will be alright. But
 do not be reckless and think you are as good as Gandalf on day one. Learning how
 to ride these things takes a while. Just enjoy riding the beast during the summer
, do road trips with your friends and that's it, you will be feeling it.
--

[CARD]
.A great opportunity
[icon=local_offer]
--
Now is the time to think of all the doors that just opened to you. Which one is
 the right one ? Which one will take you where you need to go ? Do not forget that
 Gandalf is full of tips, he probably knows which is the right door to take.
