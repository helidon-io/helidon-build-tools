        <term>disable</term>
        <tier>0</tier>
        <recommendation>Do not change. The terms &apos;disable&apos; and &apos;disabled&apos; are valid in the context of technology, such as disabling an application or a network component. In the context of talking about disabled people, however, follow the guidance around it from the AP Style Guide, the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/inclusive-language-words-to-use-and-avoid-when-writing-about-disability), the [National Center for Disability and Journalism](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/), or other sources. In most cases, the recommendation is to use the word &apos;disabled&apos; to refer to disabled people rather than alternate terms. The [National Center for Disability and Journalism](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/) recommends to specify the disability where relevant, instead of grouping all people under the general term.</recommendation>

        <term>parent child</term>
        <tier>0</tier>
        <recommendation>No change recommended. Although the relationship of parent and child is one of dependency, it is appropriate. Parents do have legal rights over children until a certain age, so it is a natural dependency relationship. Children falling victim to adult power is neither the main nor the intended result of this relationship, so this term does not typically represent an abuse of power.</recommendation>
