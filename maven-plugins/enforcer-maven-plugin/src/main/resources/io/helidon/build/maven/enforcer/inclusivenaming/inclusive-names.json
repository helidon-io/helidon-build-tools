In most cases, the recommendation is to use the word 'disabled' to refer to disabled people rather than alternate terms. The [National Center for Disability and Journalism](https://ncdj.org/style-guide/) recommends to specify the disability where relevant, instead of grouping all people under the general term.","recommended_replacements":["Deactivate/activate"],"term_page":"https://inclusivenaming.org/word-lists/no-change/disable/index.html"},{"term":"fair hiring practice","tier":"0","recommendation":"No change recommended.
