# Selection rules.
#   The CLI selects the one rule that applies to itself based on its version
#   and filters out the latest from the list above.
#
# Version range works as follows:
#   [1.0,2.0) versions 1.0 (included) to 2.0 (not included)
#   [1.0,2.0] versions 1.0 to 2.0 (both included)
#   [1.5,) versions 1.5 and higher
#   (,1.0],[1.2,) versions up to 1.0 (included) and 1.2 or higher
#
# Notes:
#   1 == 1.0 == 1.0.0
#   X-alpha is the lowest version of X

cli.[2-alpha,3-alpha).latest=[2-alpha,3-alpha)

# CLI 3.5 can only support Helidon 3.4

cli.[3.5].latest=[3.4]

# All other 3.x CLI versions should select the most recent 3.x version, including 3.5
# Rules are checked in declaration order, so the rule above will always be used for
# CLI 3.5 even though the following rule would match it if checked.
