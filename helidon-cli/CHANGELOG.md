# Helidon CLI

The Helidon CLI lets you easily create a Helidon project by picking from
a set of archetypes. It also supports a developer loop that performs
continuous compilation and application restart so you can easily
iterate over source code changes.

## Download

* [Mac OS](http://helidon.io/cli/latest/darwin/helidon)

Windows builds to come.

## Create a New Project
